Description: Run the Python script code.py in the same directory as codebook.txt.  

Let's make a new folder for challenge. And move into the folder
```
mkdir codebook
```
```
cd codebook
```
Download both files into the directory with wget.
```
wget https://artifacts.picoctf.net/c/101/code.py
```
```
wget https://artifacts.picoctf.net/c/101/codebook.txt
```

Now we can run the pyhton script to see what it does.
```
python code.py
```
This simply gives us our flag.
